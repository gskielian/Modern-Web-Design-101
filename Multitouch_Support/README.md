There are many free javascript libraries for adding multitouch and gesture controls to your website.

here you will learn how to implement a couple of your favorite features:


http://interactjs.io/ -- has a neat drag and drop utility (heavier)

http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js/ -- support for multitouch and swipe functions (lighter weight)



Remember you can't talk all the libraries with you, otherwise ppl will back button before seeing the page (unless you have an awesome animation!).
